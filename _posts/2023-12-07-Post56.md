## Task 12, Day 06, `Memory corruption` Memories of Christmas Past

Memory corruption can occur when you inadvertantly access memory you shouldn't be able to, such as variable without a max number of characters. This overflows the memory allocated and goes into memory for something else. C++ doesn't check variable boundaries.

At least sometimes, programs stop reading a variable when the first NULL character is reached. This allows storing shorter strings in variables with larger capacity. 

### The Task
Abuse the memory to beat the unbeatable game and get the flag.

Flag gotten.

#### Recommended room
Buffer Overflows
