Burp Proxy open a web interface at <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> (by defualt). Either need to alter bowser settings to use proxy, or use Firefox extension **FoxyProxy**. Allows saving proxy profiles so switching between Burp and regular use is simple. 

FoxyProxy comes in two flavors, Basic and Standard. Both allow changing proxy settings on the fly, but Standard gives more control over what traffic gets sent through the proxy (i.e. pattern matching tools). 

No proxy profiles come with initial setup. Add proxy by clicking extension > Options > Add. Need to enter:<br>
- Title - Burp (or anything else)
- Proxy IP - 127.0.0.1 (for our usage)
- Port - 8080

Future clicks on the extension button will allow selecting the proxy you want to use. When selecting "Burp" config, if Burp Suite isn't running the browser can't make any requests. 

Don't forget to toggle Intercept on and off accordingly while working. Everyone ends up with a stuck browser because of forgetting the Intercept was on.

### The Question(s)
Find a particularly useful option for the captured request. Bonis to install Standard and look into pattern matching features. (Should do that later).
