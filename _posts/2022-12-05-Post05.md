## Task 10, Day 05, <code>Brute-Forcing</code> He knows when you're awake
### Remote Access Services
- SSH - Secure Shell. Remote login with CLI
- RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol. GUI access to Windows systems. 
- VNC - Virtual Network Computing. GUI access to any type of system.

### Authentication
Make claim, like owner of username, and prove claim.
- Something you know - Password/PIN
- Something you have - Security token, mobile phone, key file
- Something you are - Biometric

### Attacking Passwords
Some types of attacks:
- Shoulder Surfing - Looking over victim's shoulder. Least technical knowledge.
- Password Guessing - Using personal details (birthdays, children's names, etc.) to guess passwords. Requires some knowledge of person.
- Dictionary Attack - Automated password guessing from wordlist or a dictionary.
- Brute Force Attack - Most exhaustive and time-consuming, tries all possible character combinations.
Make sure word lists match person's language. RockYou's wordlist has > 14 million unique passwords compiled from breaches. Top 5% is still over 0.5 million.

### The Task
Find VNC password of target and get flag through VNC connection.

#### Methodology
Scan target with nmap to find ssh/vnc services. Use Hydra to try common passwords against protocols including SSH, VNC, FTP, POP3, IMAP, SMTP, and all HTTP related methods. Syntax: <code>hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt server service</code> or <code>hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt service://server</code>
- -l - login name, omit if username not used
- -P - password(?), used to identify file containing possible passwords
- server - target IP
- service - service attacking

Optional arguments:
- -V or -vV - verbose, shows username/password combo being tried
- -d - debugging, detailed info of step (i.e. if trying to connecto to closed port and timing out, won't be secret)

Flag captured.
