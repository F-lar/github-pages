## Task 9, Day 04, <code>Scanning</code> Scanning through the snow
### Types
Two types of scanning based on intrusiveness of info gathering:

#### Passive Scanning
Scanning without directly interacting with the target device. Usually packet capture and analysis tools like Wireshark (doo doo doodoo doo doo). Basic asset info like OS version, netwrok protocol, etc, of target.

#### Active Scanning
Scan individual endpoints of network for more detailed info. Involves sending packets or queries directly to assets instead of just catching what goes by. 

### Techniques
Three standard techniques for effective info gathering:

#### Network Scanning
Helps discover complete network, any live hosts, open ports, IP addresses, services. With network mapped, attacker can execute exploits on known systems.

#### Port Scanning
Method of examining open ports capable of receiving/sending data. Reveals three types of ports:
- Closed - Host not listening to port
- Open - Host actively accepts connection to port
- Filtered - port is open, but host isn't accepting connections, or accepting connections based on certain criteria (i.e. specific IP address).

#### Vulnerability Scanning
Proactively identifies network's vulns in an automated way. Tools identify loopholes through a pre-build db of vulnerabilities. Tools include Nessus and Acunetix.

### Tools
#### Nmap
Port scanning, discover network protocols, ID running services, detect OS on live hosts. Recommended scans:
- TCP SYN - <code>nmap -sS IP address</code>
- Ping - <code>nmap -sn IP address</code>
- OS - <code>nmap -O IP adress</code>
- Services - <code>nmap -sV IP address</code>

#### Nikto
OSS that scans websites for vulns. Enables looking for subdomains, outdated servers, debug messages, etc., on a website. <code>nikto -host IP address</code>

### The Task
Use Nmap and Nikto to get information on qa.santagift.shop. Zenmap on PC couldn't do -sV scan, but AttachBox could. Nikto returns interesting info. Samba is accessed through file explorer, <code>smb://IP address</code> in address bar.
