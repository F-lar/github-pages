## Network Services part 2
### Exploiting SMB
Vulns like CVE-2017-7494 can allow RCE, but more likely to come across misconfigurations that allow access. One common misconfig allows gaining information that in turns allows shell access.

### The Task
Gain access and gather infor to get more access, then get flag. For this task SMBClient is used to gain access. Syntax to access a remote SMB share is:
<code>smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE] -U [name] -p [port]</code> where U is username and p is smb port used. Information here is based on VM from last task.

Wasn't paying attention and ctrl+z-ed my way out of smbclient and got lost. Ended up going through a walkthrough before I realized my mistake. Now however, I need to look up how to download a file over smb. While in smbclient download with <code>mget [filename]</code>.

Had to copy or move the downloaded file and couldn't remember that the destination (using mv) was <code>folder/file</code>, not <code>/folder/file</code>. 

Finally got the flag, but I really shouldn't have had to do as much research as I did. Really need to get rid of some more dust on the old skills...
