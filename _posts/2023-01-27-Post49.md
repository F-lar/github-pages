Practical application through an example attack.

Start with testing the support page for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues. This test is looking for "Reflected" XSS, only affects the person making the web request.

Tried typing in <code><script>alert("Succ3ssful XSS")</script></code> in the email field. Client-side filter prevented non-email valid characters from being typed. 

Next try bypassing client-side protection using Intercept. After replacing "email" use <code>ctrl+u</code> to make it safe to send. Forward until response gets to browser.

### End of room
Knew most of what was presented in the room just from learning on the fly in previous AoCs, but the target filtering already feels invaluable. 

The Burp module continues in the Burp Suite Repeater room, but the learning path continues with OWASP Top 10. I'll have to circle back around to Burp again at some point. I hear there's a badge for doing all(?) of the rooms.
