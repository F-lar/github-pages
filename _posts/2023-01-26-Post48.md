Target module's Sub-tabs:

- Site map: Allows mapping out the apps we're targeting in a tree structure. Every page visited while logging shows up here. Burp Pro also spiders the page automatically. Site map is especially useful for mapping out APIs.
- Scope: Allows control of Burp's target scope for the project.
- Issue Definitions: Pro has vuln scanner, Community lists all the vulnerabilities it looks for. Provides a huge list, with descriptions and references, to help building report or describing a vuln. 

### The Task
Check out every page to build the map, then find the flag and research an issue.
