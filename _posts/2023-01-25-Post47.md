Took advantage of some simple one to keep the streak going but keep working on other things. They were mostly explanitory setup items. Today's task doesn't take any action to answer the questions, but might have a couple noteworthy items.

## Scoping and Targeting
Instead of having Burp capture all traffic and muddying up logs, scoping allows limiting what Burp collects/logs. Can restrict Burp to only a certain target by using the Target module. Right-click on target from tree on left (from Site map Sub-tab), and select "Add to scope". Burp then asks if it should stop collecting out of scope data, typically choose yes. Can edit scope, including adding new targets, from Scope Sub-tab. 

That effects only logging. To disable interception of things out of scope, use Options Sub-tab of the Proxy module. From there select "<code>And</code> <code>URL</code> <code>Is in target scope</code>" from the intercept Client Responses section. Now proxy will ignore anything not in scope.
