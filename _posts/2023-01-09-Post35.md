New room in the path, "How Websites Work". Also, day 41 of the streak.

Two major components make up a website:
1. Front End (Client-Side) - the way your browser renders a website
2. Back End (Server-Side) - server that processes your request and returns a response

### HTML
- HTML - to build sites and define their structure
- CSS - to make the site look pretty by adding styling options
- JavaScript - to implement complex features on pages using interactivity

Elements/tags are building blocks of HTML pages and tells browser how to display content. Structure from the code snippet:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - defines page as HTML5 document. Helps with standardisation accross different browsers and tells the browser to use HTML5 to interpret the page.
- `<html>` - root element of the HTML page, first element in, last element out.
- `<head>` - contains information about the page (such as the page title).
- `<body>` - defines the HTML document's body. Only content inside the body is shown in the browser.
- `<h1>` - defines large heading.
- `<p>` - defines a paragraph.

Elements also contain `<button>`, `<img>`, etc.

Tags can contain attributes such as the class attribute to style the element, i.e. <code>`<p class="bold-text">`</code>, or the src attribute to specify location of images <code>`<img src="img/cat.jpg">`</code>. Elements can have multiple attributes, space delimited. 

Elements can also have an id attribute, i.e. <code>`<p id="example">`</code>, which is unique to element. Element IDs are used for styling and to identify it by JavaScript.
