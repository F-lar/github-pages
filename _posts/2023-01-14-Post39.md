### HTTP Status Codes
Status codes inform client of the outcome of its request and potentially how to handle it. Can be broken into 5 different ranges:

| Range | Type | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :----- |
| 100-199 | Information<br>Response | Tells client first part of request has been<br>accepted and it should continue<br>sending the rest of the request.<br>(No longer common) |
| 200-299 | Success | Tells client the request was successful. |
| 300-399 | Redirection | Redirects the request to another<br>resource, whether different page<br>or entirely different site. |
| 400-499 | Client<br>Errors | Informs client there was an error<br>with the request. |
| 500-599 | Server<br>Errors | For server-side errors, usually indicating<br>a major problem with the server<br>handling the request. |

Most common status codes:

| Code | Name | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 200 | OK | Request completed successfully. |
| 201 | Created | A resource has been created.<br>(i.e. new user or blog post) |
| 301 | Permanent<br>Redirect | Redirects browser to new webpage<br>or tells search engines the<br>page has moved and where to look. |
|302 | Temporary<br>Redirect | Same as above but that it<br>might change again in the near future. |
| 400 | Bad<br>Request | Tells the browser something was<br>either wrong or missing in the<br>request. (i.e. resource expecting<br>a parameter not received) |
| 401 | Not<br>Authorized | Not currently allowed to view<br>resource until authorized<br> with webapp. |
| 403 | Forbidden | No permission to view resource<br>whether logged in or not. |
| 404 | Page Not<br>Found | Page/resource requested doesn't exist. |
| 405 | Method Not<br>Allowed | Resource does not allow this<br>method request. (i.e. GET request<br>received when expecting POST) |
| 500 | Internal<br>Service Error | Server encountered some sort of<br>error the request that it doesn't<br>know how to handle. |
| 503 | Service<br>Unavailable | Server can't handle request because<br>overloaded or down for maintenance. |
