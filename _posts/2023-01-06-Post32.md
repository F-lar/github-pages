### Exploiting SMTP
This is leveraging SMTP information to gain SSH access to the system. The previous enumeration revealed an open SSH port, a username, and the type of SMTP server and OS running. 

Hyrda syntax:
<code>hydra -t 16 -l [username] -P /path/to/wordlist.txt -vV [ip address] protocol</code>

- -t - number of parallel connections per target
- -l - target user account
- -P - path to dictionary
- -vV - very verbose, shows login+pass combination for each attempt
- ip address - target IP Address
- protocol - sets protocol (i.e. SSH)

### The Task
Login through SSH and grab the flag. 

Done and done.
