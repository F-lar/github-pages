The two tasks I think I'm going to stick to are on Installation and The Dashboard, so there may not be many notes.

Dashboard has four quadrants:<br>

| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 3 |
| 2 | 4 |

1. Tasks menu: Allows defining background tasks that Burp Suite will run while open. Default is "Live Passive Crawl" which automatically logs pages visited. Pro allows creating on-demand scans.
2. Event log: Tells what Burp Suite is doing (i.e. starting the Proxy), as well as info about connections being made through Burp.
3. Issue Activity: Exclusive to Burp Pro, lists all vulnerabilities found by the sutomated scanner. Ranked by severity and filterable by how sure Burp is that the component is vulnerable.
4. Advisory section: gives more information about the vulnerabilities found, references, and suggested remediations. Items can be exportes into reports. 

Contextual help is given through a '?' in a circle.

No questions, just fighting to figure out my archive problem again. Making slow progress at least.
