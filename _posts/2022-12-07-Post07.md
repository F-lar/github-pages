## Task 12, Day 07, <code>CyberChef</code> Maldocs roasting on an open fire
Had to skip yesterday's challenge and post, so they're doubled today. I kept a simple question in the wings to keep the streak alive though. Glad for this one because I'm always looking for a fun reason to use CyberChef.

New acronym, C2 - Command and Control Infrastructure. Really digging the new(ish) wiki-type links in the tasks.
