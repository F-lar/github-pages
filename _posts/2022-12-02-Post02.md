## Task 7, Day 02, <code>Log Analysis</code> Santa's Naughty & Nice Log
Windows logs available through Event Viewer. 

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian) has OS logs and often software-specific logs (i.e. apache2) in <code>/var/log</code>. Ubuntu logs include:
_auth.log_ - Authentication
_dpkg.log_ - Package (software) Management
_syslog_ - Background items, i.e. crontabs executing, services starting/stopping, log rotation, etc.
_kern.log_ - Kernel. Changes to kernel, output from devices like network equipment and USB devices

Acronym I always forget - SIEM - Security Information and Event Management. Splunk is example of SIEM software, aggregates logs for analysis.

### Grep
Default search location is current working directory.
<code>grep</code> <code>options</code> <code>filename</code> or <code>path/filename</code>.

Suggested search terms include:
    -device name
    -file name
    -user name
    -IP address
    -certain time or date

Common options include:
    - <code>-i</code> case insensitive search
    - <code>-E</code> use regex (regular expressions) i.e. "thm|tryhackme" to search for lines with either word
    - <code>-r</code> recursive search (search all files in directory)

### The Task
Deploy VM and search the logs. Feel like I cheated on two questions because I took an educated guess rather than finding concrete evidence. Had to watch the video and realized I thought about a search term but hadn't tried it. Yeesh.
