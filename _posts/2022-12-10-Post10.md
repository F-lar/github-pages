## Task 15, Day 10, <code>Hack a Game</code> You're a mean one, Mr. Yeti
I think I tripped over a rock and died.

### Cetus Operators
- EQ - Find all memory addresses with contents equal to the input
- NE - !=
- LT - <
- GT - >
- LTE - <=
- GTE - >=

Need to set up search correctly for integers or floats because 32 and 32.0 are recorded differently in memory. Once a memory location is found and bookmarked it can be easily read or modified in hex.

Can also do differential searches by searching with blank search input and manipulating data through movement and operands to deduce what you want.

### The Task
Get out of the game and grab flags along the way.

It was a little annoying finding what I was looking for, but still fun after yesterday's complicated marathon.
