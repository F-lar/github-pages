## Network Services part 3
Made it to 31 days in the streak, but this will be a short one.

### Understanding Telnet
**Telnet** -application protocol that allows you to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server. I have an advantage in using this somewhat regularly at work for a debugger terminal to test logic points.

Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms, so has been replaced by SSH in most implementations.

Connections made with <code>telnet [ip/hostname] [port]</code>. Guess who alwasy forgets to include the port number when connecting to the debugger.

All questions answered, but no more time, so I'm off.
