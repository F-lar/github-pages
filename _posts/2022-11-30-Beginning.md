I started trying to get this site up and running after last year's AoC event. I had a good streak going, was learning all sorts of stuff, and wanted to keep better track of it than random notes and pages in various notebooks. Unfortunately I could never get it up and running, then I lost my streak and my desire. With AoC kicking off again in a few hours I wanted to try and get it running again. 

Here's hoping...

_Edit:_ It worked! Hopefully changing the theme has worked and it's still displaying properly when I'm done with this. [Narrator's voice]: _It wasn't._
