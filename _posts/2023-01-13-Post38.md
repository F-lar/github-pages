Since I'm trying to get an archives section going and cut down the clutter on the homepage I'm only doing one task and it's a short one. 

### HTTP Methods
**Method** - a way for the client to show their intended action when making an HTTP request. This makes something from the last task make more sense. The most common follow, but mostly you deal with the first two:
- GET - used to get information from a web server
- POST - used for submitting data to the web server and potentially creating new records
- PUT - used for submitting data to a web server to update information
- DELETE - used for deleting information/records from a web server

### The Questions
Which methods are used for each of the following tasks...

Questions done, streak extended to 45. Wonder if the 5% discount on swag will come up again. 

On to fighting with my own project.
